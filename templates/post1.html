    <p class="eat"> Eating a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables,
         whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats is important for 
         maintaining overall health.
          It can also help prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes,
          heart disease, and certain cancers.A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in
           all its forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes, heart disease, 
           stroke and cancer.<br>
          Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are leading global risks to health.
          Healthy dietary practices start early in life – breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and
           improves cognitive development, and may have longer term health benefits such as reducing the risk
            of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.<br>

        <div class="eater">
          Energy intake (calories) should be in balance with energy expenditure. To avoid unhealthy weight gain,
           total fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake. Intake of saturated fats should be less 
           than 10% of total energy intake, and intake of trans-fats less than 1% of total energy intake, with a shift
            in fat consumption away from saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats, and towards the goal of
             eliminating industrially-produced trans-fats.<br>
          Limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake is part of a healthy diet.
           A further reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake is suggested for additional health benefits .
          Keeping salt intake to less than 5 g per day (equivalent to sodium intake of less than 2 g per day) helps 
          to prevent hypertension, and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in the adult population .</p>

        <div class="eater">
            Diet evolves over time, being influenced by many social
             and economic factors that interact in a complex manner to shape individual dietary patterns
             . These factors include income, food prices (which will affect the availability and affordability 
             of healthy foods), individual preferences and beliefs, cultural traditions, and geographical and 
             environmental aspects (including climate change). Therefore, promoting a healthy food environment –
              including food systems that promote a diversified, balanced and healthy diet – requires the involvement 
              of multiple sectors and stakeholders, including government, and the public and private sectors.

Governments have a central role in creating a healthy food environment that enables people to adopt and maintain 
healthy dietary practices.

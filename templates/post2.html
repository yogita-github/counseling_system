    <p class="eat"> Good sleep is a topic that is often neglected, 
        but it is a very important aspect of our everyday life. Sleep has been extensively studied and
         affects our quality of life in many ways — be it our efficiency at work, our endurance when it 
         comes to daily tasks, or the prevention of diseases and maintenance of mental health, just to name a few.
         <br><br>
         It strongly influences our capacity to recover both mentally and physically, allows us to store
          memories, influences our mood, and promotes "growing" in children. It basically impacts every aspect
           of our life by affecting the way we think, learn, behave, feel, and interact with others.

            Poor sleep and sleep deprivation have been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, 
            impaired mental capacity, and poor motor coordination. Specialists have shown that “healthy sleep” 
            might be the best way to prevent Alzheimer’s disease and that there is a strong relationship between
             sleep and proper functioning of the immune system.

            While sleep disorders and the impact of sleep on general health have been extensively studied, 
            
            the conditions necessary for good sleep, often called “sleep hygiene,” is sometimes overlooked.
            
            Many times we prefer to look directly at pathology and label our sleeping problems as a disease. 
            We turn too quickly to medication and skip the simple yet critical changes we could easily make to
             get better sleep.</p>

        <h3 style="padding-left: 50px;padding-top: 30px;">Essential rules for good sleep</h3>
        
        <ul  class="inc"style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li> Sleep in well-ventilated rooms and air out your home frequently - During respiration, 
                we take up oxygen from the air and release carbon dioxide (CO2). Sleeping in closed, small 
                rooms or confined spaces leads to CO2 buildup.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to room temperature, air humidity, and pollution - The conditions for good sleep are met when 
                the body doesn’t have to regulate its own temperature, reaching what is called the “thermoneutrality state.”</li>
            <li> Turn off all sources of light - Sleep is governed by light. Our internal clock (a group of cells in
                 the hypothalamus) receives the signals that the eye sends in the presence of darkness or light.</li>
          </ul>
